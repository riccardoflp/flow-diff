/**
 * Staged-chunk detection for HEAD↔worktree models.
 * No `vscode` import — unit-testable with plain node.
 *
 * A chunk is staged when the index agrees with the worktree on the chunk's
 * region: staging copies worktree content into the index, so once a chunk is
 * staged no index↔worktree difference touches its lines anymore. Partially
 * staged chunks still differ there and stay unmarked.
